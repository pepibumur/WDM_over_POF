Final Degree Project of Telecommunication Engineer / 2014
============

Analysis and viability of WDM technology in POF networks - Final degree project

### Project steps
Steps I followed to that project are the following one:

1. Documentation: _Referencies [1],[4],[4b],[5-11],_
2. WDM carriers in POF
3. WDM devices for those channels. Available technologies revision.
..* Parameters: IL, â€¦
4. Fiber Bragg Grating in POF [17-27]: compatible lambdas with transmision in POF. _Tesis N.G. Harbach and Ian Johnson_
5. Purpose and viability of multichannel in-building system with selected deviced and operation characterization: B and L ( capacity ), etc.

### Setup Sublime to compile project Memory
Project memory is written using Latext language. What does it mean?, to convert into PDF or similar format you need Latex interpreter installed within your computer to compile it. The easiest way is following that [tutorial](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools)

- **OSX Tutorial** - [Tutorial](http://sam.bitmorse.com/posts/easy-and-fast-latex-editing-with-sublime-text-2-and-skim-pdf-viewer/)

### Components

- `/resources` : Documents which project is based in.
- `/helpers` : Short programs developed in  Matlab or Ruby to evaluate, calculate, and generate valuable information to attach in the memory.

### Resources
- **Latext first steps:** [Resource](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/ecn297/latex_tut.pdf)
- **Markdown cheatsheet:** [Resource](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
